Over what scale factors are the various kernels acceptable?

	Used eye50.pgm
	Box: 4x
	Triangle: 5x
	Cubic: 7x
	Lanczos: 10x
	Hann: 10x
	Hamming: 10x

Describe the artifacts that appear, including their location and structure.

	As we make the image bigger, the artifacts start to appear more. 
	These artifacts become more visible around edges and areas with high contrast 
	such as the color difference between the eye and person's skin in eye50.pgm. 

Compare the results between the point sampling (nearest neighbor) and a higher quality filter when minifying star.pgm or ramp.pgm.

	When minifying star.pgm using point sampling, it creates 
	distortions in the rings closer to the center. When we switch to the 
	higher quality filters, it removes these distortions by blurring it into the image. 
	This makes the image appear the same as the original just minimized.
	When we minify ramp.pgm the point sampling and the higher quality filters both have 	similar output image.

Why does point sampling work well for the ramp.pgm image and not for star.pgm?

	Point sampling works well for the ramp.pgm as the color smoothly transitions from
	black to white. The information that is lost when miniying isn't as noticable as
	it is for star.pgm. In star.pgm, the colors quickly switch from black to white
	which will create the distortions due to aliasing in the inner circle that we see 
	when minifying.
